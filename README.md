**Scale Liquidity. Master the Game.**
The PARTNER ECOSYSTEM is for those who understand that the market rewards consistency, precision, and alignment.

## 0. PREMISE
We don't sell promises. We deliver structural advantage.
Connect to the most advanced liquidity infrastructure. Here, execution quality defines everything.

## 1. Liquidity as a Service (LaaS)
Your liquidity provision is adjusted to your risk design:
- Aggressive
- Defensive
- Strategic Conservative

Here, your operation is calibrated by a **specialized autonomous agent**, aligned with your profile, working 24/7 for you. You talk to your agent. It executes. The system learns.

## 2. Elite Access
Institutional Desk. This is AA’s Elite. You sit where normally no one is invited.
- High Speed Execution
- Intelligent Automation
- Early Access to Alpha
- Dedicated Infrastructure

## 3. Integrity Protocol (The Judge)
- **Clean Slate Law (SBT)**: Restricted access via Zero-Knowledge Compliance.
- **Success Fee Law**: Total alignment. 97% You / 3% Treasury.
- **Ethical Code**: Knowledge for Good. No Exit Liquidity at the expense of the community.

## Production

## Hackathon Focus

- **Multi-Strategy Execution**: Agent capable of operating in multiple modalities (Scalp, Day Trade, Swing, Position, Arb).
- **Yield Farming Automation**: OBI acts as an autonomous "Volume Farmer", generating on-chain and off-chain activity to maximize points and rewards on Perp DEXs (Backpack, and in the future Jupiter, Drift, Zeta).
- **On-Chain Validation**: All executions generate auditable cryptographic receipts (Solana Signer).
- **Proof of Volume**: Visible metrics proven in the laboratory.
- **Audit Report**: [SCALP_LAB_REPORT.md](./SCALP_LAB_REPORT.md) - Technical document with telemetry, latency (<350ms), and PnL.

## Ecosystem Utility (Solana DeFi)

OBI is not just a trading bot; it is a **portable liquidity infrastructure** for the Solana ecosystem.

*   **Farm Perp DEX**: Designed to systematically "farm" incentive programs (Points/Airdrops) on protocols like Backpack, Drift, and Jupiter Perps.
*   **Liquidity as a Service**: DeFi projects can integrate OBI to ensure 24/7 liquidity in their markets, paying performance fees via Smart Contracts.
*   **Total Integration**: Uses AgentWallet to interact natively with any on-chain Solana instruction.

## Core Capabilities (Labs)

The execution infrastructure ("Backend Core") includes dedicated laboratories for strategy validation:

1.  **Scalp Lab**: High Frequency Trading, Market Making, and Spread Capture.
2.  **Day Trade Lab**: Intraday trends (EMA Crossover).
3.  **Swing Trade Lab**: Medium-term momentum (MACD).
4.  **Position Lab**: Long-term allocation (Golden Cross/HODL).
5.  **Arbitrage Lab**: Spot-Perp Basis Monitoring.
