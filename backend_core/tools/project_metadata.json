  "description": "Double Green (Solo Team). OBI is a sovereign hedge fund operating on Backpack Exchange. Unlike passive tools, OBI is an active capital allocator running high-frequency strategies (Scalp/Arb/Yield) with <400ms latency. We bridge the gap between 'Agentic AI' and 'Real Yield' by enforcing a 'Proof of Profit' protocol: every trade is cryptographically signed (Ed25519) and verified on-chain. This is not a simulation. This is OBI.",
