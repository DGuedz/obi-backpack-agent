## 1. Market Analysis

*   **Check Macroeconomic Events**: Use an economic calendar to identify central bank announcements, employment reports, or corporate earnings that may generate volatility. If a high-impact event is near, decide whether to stay out of the market or adjust the strategy.
*   **Evaluate Market Sentiment**: Determine if the market is in "risk-on" or "risk-off" mode. This influences currencies, commodities, and equities.
*   **Analyze Technical Trends**: Mark key support and resistance levels and confirm direction with technical indicators (Moving Averages, Trendlines, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.). Only operate in favor of a clear trend; avoid sideways or directionless markets.

## 2. Entry and Exit Criteria

*   **Define Objective Entry Criteria**: Specific candlestick patterns, moving average crossovers, channel breakouts, or other rules of your strategy. Only enter if **all** conditions are met.
