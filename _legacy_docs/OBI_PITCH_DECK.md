# OBI WORK: The Institutional Edge for Retail
## Pitch Deck (Q1 2026)

---

### Slide 1: The Hook
**Title:** OBI WORK | Institutional Trading Engineering
**Subtitle:** "Don't Trust. Verify."
**One-Liner:** We build the infrastructure that retail traders lack to survive in an algorithmic market.

---

### Slide 2: The Problem
**"Retail is Liquidity"**
- **The Reality:** 90% of retail traders fail within 90 days.
- **Why?** They bring a knife to a nuclear war.
- **The Gap:** Institutions use HFT, Order Book Imbalance (OBI), and automated execution. Retail uses manual clicks and emotional guessing.
- **Result:** Retail traders are not participants; they are the "Exit Liquidity" for whales.

---

### Slide 3: The Solution
**Infrastructure, Not Just Signals**
- **OBI WORK Ecosystem:** A complete operating system for serious traders.
- **Core Technology:** 
  - **OBI Analysis:** Real-time Order Book Imbalance detection (Supply/Demand pressure).
  - **Automation:** "Sentinel" modules for risk management (Stop-Loss/Take-Profit) that never sleep.
  - **Execution:** Zero-latency execution via API, bypassing manual UI lag.
- **Philosophy:** Eliminate emotion. Execute with mathematical precision.

---

### Slide 4: Tech Stack (Under the Hood)
**Built for Speed & Reliability**
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (React) + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion (High-performance UI).
- **Core Engine:** Python (Pandas/Numpy) for heavy quantitative analysis.
- **Connectivity:** Direct API Binding (Rust-based wrappers) to Backpack Exchange.
- **Infrastructure:** RPC Nodes & WebSocket streams for real-time data ingestion.
- **Security:** "Iron Dome" protocol (AWS KMS + Local Encrypted Env) for key management.
