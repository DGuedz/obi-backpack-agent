Backpack Exchange API (1.0)

Introduction
Welcome to the Backpack Exchange API. This API is for programmatic trade execution. All of the endpoints require requests to be signed with an ED25519 keypair for authentication.

The API is hosted at https://api.backpack.exchange/ and the WS API is hosted at wss://ws.backpack.exchange/.

Authentication
Signing requests
Signed requests are required for any API calls that mutate state. Additionally, some read only requests can be performed by signing or via session authentication.

Signed requests require the following additional headers:

X-Timestamp - Unix time in milliseconds that the request was sent.
X-Window - Time window in milliseconds that the request is valid for, default is 5000 and maximum is 60000.
X-API-Key - Base64 encoded verifying key of the ED25519 keypair.
X-Signature - Base64 encoded signature generated according to the instructions below.
Generate ED25519 Keys
You can generate a private/public ED25519 keypair using this Python one-liner:

python3 -c "from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import ed25519; import base64; key = ed25519.Ed25519PrivateKey.generate(); seed = key.private_bytes_raw(); pub = key.public_key().public_bytes_raw(); print(f'Seed: {base64.b64encode(seed).decode()}\nPublic Key: {base64.b64encode(pub).decode()}')"
This will output your base64-encoded private key (seed) and public key that can be used for API authentication.

Signature Generation
To generate a signature perform the following:

The key/values of the request body or query parameters should be ordered alphabetically and then turned into query string format.

Append the header values for the timestamp and receive window to the above generated string in the format &timestamp=<timestamp>&window=<window>. If no X-Window header is passed the default value of 5000 still needs to be added to the signing string.

Each request also has an instruction type, valid instructions are:

accountQuery
balanceQuery
borrowLendExecute
borrowHistoryQueryAll
collateralQuery
depositAddressQuery
depositQueryAll
fillHistoryQueryAll
fundingHistoryQueryAll
interestHistoryQueryAll
orderCancel
orderCancelAll
orderExecute
orderHistoryQueryAll
orderQuery
orderQueryAll
pnlHistoryQueryAll
positionHistoryQueryAll
positionQuery
quoteSubmit
strategyCancel
strategyCancelAll
strategyCreate
strategyHistoryQueryAll
strategyQuery
strategyQueryAll
withdraw
withdrawalQueryAll
The correct instruction type should be prefixed to the signing string. The instruction types for each request are documented alongside the request.

For example, an API request to cancel an order with the following body:

{
    "orderId": 28
    "symbol": "BTC_USDT",
}
Would require the following to be signed:

instruction=orderCancel&orderId=28&symbol=BTC_USDT&timestamp=1614550000000&window=5000
Regarding batch order execution (POST /orders), for each order in the batch, the order parameters should be ordered alphabetically and then turned into query string format. The orderExecute instruction should then be prefixed to that string. The query strings for the orders should be concatenated with & and the timestamp and window appended at the end.

For example, an API request for an order execution batch with the following body:

[
    {
        "symbol": "SOL_USDC_PERP",
        "side": "Bid",
        "orderType": "Limit",
        "price": "141",
        "quantity": "12"
    },
    {
        "symbol": "SOL_USDC_PERP",
        "side": "Bid",
        "orderType": "Limit",
        "price": "140",
        "quantity": "11"
    }
]
Would require the following to be signed:

instruction=orderExecute&orderType=Limit&price=141&quantity=12&side=Bid&symbol=SOL_USDC_PERP&instruction=orderExecute&orderType=Limit&price=140&quantity=11&side=Bid&symbol=SOL_USDC_PERP&timestamp=1750793021519&window=5000
If the API endpoint requires query parameters instead of a request body, the same procedure should be used on the query parameters. If the API endpoint does not have a request body or query parameters, only the timestamp and receive window need to be signed.

This message should be signed using the private key of the ED25519 keypair that corresponds to the public key in the X-API-Key header. The signature should then be base64 encoded and submitted in the X-Signature header.




Changelog
2025-11-12
Backstop liquidation fills now include a non-zero tradeId field on an on-going basis. Previously such fills had a zero tradeId. This applies to the /fills endpoint as well as the trade stream.
2025-11-10
Add a specific error message for withdrawal attempts to non-2FA exempt withdrawal addresses.
Set a default limit of 1000 levels each side of the book for /depth endpoint.
2025-10-23
Add j and k fields to the order update stream (take profit limit price and stop loss limit price).
2025-09-02
The /depth endpoint now returns a limit of 5,000 price levels on each side of the book.
2025-09-01
The cumulativeInterest response field is being removed from the /positionendpoint.
Estimated liquidation price or l is being removed from the position update stream. It will remain as a placeholder and be set to 0. It will be removed in the future, so client's should not rely on its presence.
Liquidation price can be queried for a single position using the Positions API /position for example /position?symbol=BTC_USDC_PERP.
2025-08-07
/history/pnl has been removed.
2025-06-08
The order id format is changing, it is no longer a byte shifted timestamp. It is no longer possible to derive the order timestamp from the order id. This change will take place at Monday June 9th, 01:00 UTC.
2025-04-22
The /fills endpoint now returns all fills for the account, including fills from system orders as well as client orders. System orders include liquidations, ADLs and collateral conversions. Previously, by default, it only returned fills from client orders. This behavior can be achieved by setting the fillType parameter to User.
2025-04-08
Added funding rate lower and upper bounds to /markets and /market endpoints.
2025-03-26
Add open interest stream openInterest.<symbol>.
Added the option to query /history/borrowLend/positions with a signed request using the instruction borrowPositionHistoryQueryAll.
2025-03-19
The leverage filter has been removed from /markets and /market endpoints.
Added /openInterest now takes symbol as an optional parameter. When not set, all markets are returned.
/openInterests has been deprecated.
Add stop loss and take profit fields to /orders/execute.
Add I field to the order update stream (related order id).
Add a and b fields to the order update stream (take profit trigger price and stop loss trigger price).
2025-02-28
Added clientId to fill history.
2025-02-11
An O field has been added to the order update stream. It denotes the origin of the update. The possible values are:
USER: The origin of the update was due to order entry by the user.
LIQUIDATION_AUTOCLOSE: The origin of the update was due to a liquidation by the liquidation engine.
ADL_AUTOCLOSE: The origin of the update was due to an ADL (auto-deleveraging) event.
COLLATERAL_CONVERSION: The origin of the update was due to a collateral conversion to settle debt on the account.
SETTLEMENT_AUTOCLOSE: The origin of the update was due to the settlement of a position on a dated market.
BACKSTOP_LIQUIDITY_PROVIDER: The origin of the update was due to a backstop liquidity provider facilitating a liquidation.
2025-02-07
Added r to denote a reduce only order on the order updates stream.
Added reduceOnly to the get orders endpoint.
2025-02-03
Added openInterestLimit to the markets endpoint. Applicable to futures markets only.
Added orderModified event to the order update stream. A resting reduce only order's quantity can be decreased in order to prevent position side reversal.
2025-01-09
Added marketType to the markets endpoint.
Added an optional marketType filter to the fills and the orders endpoints.
2024-12-03

Added a maximum value for the X-Window header of 60000.
2024-01-16
Breaking
A new websocket API is available at wss://ws.backpack.exchange. Please see the documentation. The previous API remains on the same endpoint and will be deprecated after a migration period. The new API changes the following:
Subscription endpoint is now wss://ws.backpack.exchange instead of wss://ws.backpack.exchange/stream.
Can subscribe and unsubscribe to/from multiple streams by passing more than one in the params field.
Signature should now be sent in a separate signature field.
Signature instruction changed from accountQuery to subscribe.
Event and engine timestamps are now in microseconds instead of milliseconds.
Add engine timestamp to bookTicker, depth, and order streams.
Add quote asset volume to ticker stream.
Add sequential trade id to trade stream.
Rename the event type in the depth stream from depthEvent to depth.
Change the format of streams from <symbol>@<type> to <type>.<symbol> or kline.<interval>.<symbol> for K-lines.
Flatten the K-Line in the K-line stream so its not nested.
2024-01-11
Breaking
Replaced identifier field on deposits with transaction_hash and provider_id. This aims to provide clearer representation of the field, particularly for fiat deposits.
Removed duplicate pending values from the WithdrawalStatus and DepositStatus spec enum.

Streams
Usage
Subscribing
To use the websocket API, connect to wss://ws.backpack.exchange.

To subscribe to a stream with the name stream send a text frame over the websocket connection with the following JSON payload:

{
  "method": "SUBSCRIBE",
  "params": ["stream"]
}
Similarly, to unsubscribe from a stream with the name stream:

{
  "method": "UNSUBSCRIBE",
  "params": ["stream"]
}
You can subscribe or unsubscribe from multiple streams if you include more than one in the params field.

All data from streams is wrapped in a JSON object of the following form:

{
  "stream": "<stream>",
  "data": "<payload>"
}
The following command can be used to test subscribing to a stream:

(sleep 1; \
echo '{"method":"SUBSCRIBE","params":["depth.SOL_USDC"]}';\
cat) |\
wscat -c wss://ws.backpack.exchange
The payloads for each stream time are outlined below.

Timing
Timestamps are in microseconds (except for the K-line start and end times). The event timestamp is the time the event was emitted from the websocket server, and the engine timestamp is the time the event was generated by the matching engine.

If a message aggregates more than one event (for example, a depth message), the engine timestamp will be the timestamp of the last matching engine event.

Keeping the connection alive
To keep the connection alive, a Ping frame will be sent from the server every 60s, and a Pong is expected to be received from the client. If a Pong is not received within 120s, a Close frame will be sent and the connection will be closed.

If the server is shutting down, a Close frame will be sent and then a grace period of 30s will be given before the connection is closed. The client should reconnect after receiving the Close frame. The client will be reconnected to a server that is not shutting down.

Private
Subscribing to a private stream requires a valid signature generated from an ED25519 keypair. For stream subscriptions, the signature should be of the form:

instruction=subscribe&timestamp=1614550000000&window=5000
Where the timestamp and window are in milliseconds.

Private streams are prefixed with account. and require signature data to be submitted in the subscribe parameters. The verifying key and signature should be base64 encoded.

{
  "method": "SUBSCRIBE",
  "params": ["stream"],
  "signature": ["<verifying key>", "<signature>", "<timestamp>", "<window>"]
}
Order update
On any mutation to an order the order will be pushed to the order update stream. The event type of the order update will be one of the following:

orderAccepted
orderCancelled
orderExpired
orderFill
orderModified
triggerPlaced
triggerFailed
An orderModified update will be received when a resting reduce only order's quantity is decreased in order to prevent position side reversal.

ADL_AUTOCLOSE: The origin of the update was due to an ADL (auto-deleveraging) event.
COLLATERAL_CONVERSION: The origin of the update was due to a collateral conversion to settle debt on the account.
SETTLEMENT_AUTOCLOSE: The origin of the update was due to the settlement of a position on a dated market.
BACKSTOP_LIQUIDITY_PROVIDER: The origin of the update was due to a backstop liquidity provider facilitating a liquidation.
Some fields are conditional on the order settings or event type:

c - Only present if the order has a client order ID.

RFQ Update
This WebSocket stream provides real-time updates on RFQs (Request for Quotes) that are relevant to makers. Events are pushed to this stream whenever there is a significant state change in an RFQ or its associated quotes, allowing makers to monitor and respond to RFQs as they progress through various states.

Event Types
For RFQs that submitted by other requesters.

rfqActive: Indicates that an RFQ is active and open for quotes.
For RFQs that submitted by your account.

rfqAccepted: Indicates that an RFQ has been accepted and is no
rfqRefreshed: Indicates that an RFQ has been refreshed, is active and open for quotes.
rfqCancelled: Indicates that an RFQ has been cancelled or expired.
rfqCandidate: RFQ has received a new best quote.
rfqFilled: Indicates that an RFQ has been fully filled with a quote.
For Quotes submitted by your account.

quoteAccepted: Indicates that a quote submitted by the maker has been accepted.
quoteCancelled: Indicates that a quote has been cancelled due to quote submission, RFQ being filled, refreshed, cancelled, or expired.
Quote Submission and RFQ Timing
Makers should submit quotes before the submission time (w field) is reached, as indicated in each rfqActive event. An RFQ remains active until the expiration time (W field). If no quote is accepted or the RFQ is not cancelled, makers may continue to submit quotes until expiration.

RFQs can periodically request new quotes by issuing additional rfqActive events. Each new rfqActive event will have the same RFQ ID (R field) but updated values for submission time and expiration time, allowing makers to participate in extended or renewed quoting periods for ongoing RFQs.

Stream Name Format
For all markets: account.rfqUpdate
For single market: account.rfqUpdate.<symbol>

Field Descriptions
e - Event type (e.g., rfqActive, rfqAccepted, rfqRefreshed, rfqCancelled, quoteAccepted, quoteCancelled, rfqCandidate, rfqFilled).
E - Event time in microseconds.
R - RFQ ID, identifying the request for quote.
u - Quote ID, identifying the specific quote.
C - Client ID (either Client RFQ ID or Client Quote ID depending on context).
s - Symbol the RFQ is for.
S - Side of the RFQ, either "Bid" or "Ask".
q - Quantity for the RFQ (in base asset, if quantity in base asset).
Q - Quote quantity for the RFQ (in quote asset, if quantity in quote asset).
p - Price associated with the quote/fill event.
w - Submission time for the RFQ in milliseconds.
W - Expiry time for the RFQ in milliseconds.
X - Order status (e.g., New, Cancelled, Filled).
T - Engine timestamp in microseconds.
Some fields are conditional and may be present only in specific events. RFQs are either requested in base quantity or quote quantity, but not both. Either q or Q will be present.

Depth
Contains incremental depth updates. Each depth update has the absolute value of the depths at the given levels, and only changes when the depth has changed.

To obtain an initial snapshot of the depth, the client should query the REST API.

The depth stream will push updates as quickly as possible, but under load it may aggregate more than one update into a single event. In this case the U and u fields will not be the same. The U field is the first update ID in the event, and the u field is the final update ID in the event.

There are alternative depth streams that aggregates updates into a single message over a 200ms, 600ms or 1000ms period instead of pushing updates in realtime. This is useful for reducing network traffic.

Updates are sequential, so U will always be u + 1 from the previous message. If this is not the case, the client should assume that the depth has been invalidated and requery the REST API.
